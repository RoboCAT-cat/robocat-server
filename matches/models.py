    # Pseudocode: Each field contains a pseudocode explaining its effects, on which the following
    # conventions are used:
    # `self` is the current team, `other` is the adversary;
    # `score` and `qualification_points` are the results, the score and the qualification_points respectively
    # Assuming the white team, `self.x` is the `x_white` (or `white_x`) field
    # and `Ã²ther.x` is the `x_black` (or `black_x`) field. The converse is true for the black team.

    # Disqualification: The referees may disqualify a team under the following circumstances:
    # a) an act outlined in The Rules as being disqualifying is commited,
    # b) an act is commited that the organization deems disqualifying, on the basis that undermines
    #    the event's code of conduct (i.e. the team cheats or otherwise seriously 
    #    and purposefully interferes with the match),
    # c) a team fails to show up to a match -- possibly after several calls, or
    # d) a team fails to abide by any other ad lib rule. Such rules are created when an
    #    unexpected situation not covered by The Rules is observed and acted upon*.
    #    Such rules are repeatedly communicated by the staff.
    # A disqualified team:
    # - does not receive any score for the match
    # - does not receive any qualification points, regardless
    #   of the other team's score, and whether it has also been disqualified.
    # * Ad-libbed rules are rare, and used mostly to prevent blatant loophole abuse.
    #   As a rule of thumb, a team should use common sense and, if in doubt, ask
    #   the organization when designing a strategy.
